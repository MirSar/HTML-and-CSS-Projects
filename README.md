#HTML and CSS Projects
------------------------------------------------------
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.
This is part of my course work for The Tech Academy's Software Developer
program.

##PROJECTS
------------------------------------------------------
* SarLuxRejuvenation 
* SarCinemas

###SarLux Rejuvenation Site

This page is an example home page for a beauty clinic. I's styled using
CSS and contains navbar, image containers, and a form.

###SarCinemas Site

This page is an example home page for a an online chatting site with a video
context in the background.  Unlike traditional cinemas chatting is
highly encouraged :) This site is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many
Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form,
cards, and dropdowns.
